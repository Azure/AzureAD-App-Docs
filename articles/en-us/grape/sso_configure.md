## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Gra-Pe, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Gra-Pe single sign-on enabled subscription

> **Note:**
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

### Configuring Gra-Pe for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Gra-Pe** side, you need to send the **[Downloaded Azure AD Signing Certifcate (Base64 encoded)](%metadata:certificateDownloadBase64Url%)** and copied **Login URL** : %metadata:singleSignOnServiceUrl%, **Azure AD Identifier, Logout URL** to [Gra-Pe support team](https://www.toppantravel.com/inquiry/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

## Quick Reference
