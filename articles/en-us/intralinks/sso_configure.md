To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

### Configuring Intralinks for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Intralinks** side, you need to send the downloaded **[Metadata XML](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)** [Intralinks support team](https://www.intralinks.com/contact-1). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
