> **Note:**
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

### Configuring Bomgar Remote Support for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Bomgar Remote Support** side, you need to send the **[Downloaded SAML Metadata file](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)** to [Bomgar Remote Support support team](https://www.bomgar.com/docs/index.htm#support). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

## Quick Reference

* **Azure AD Single Sign-On Service URL** : %metadata:singleSignOnServiceUrl%

* **Azure AD Sign Out URL** : %metadata:singleSignOutServiceUrl%

* **Azure AD SAML Entity ID** : %metadata:IssuerUri%

* **[Download SAML Metadata file](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)**
