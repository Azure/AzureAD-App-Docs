### Configuring helpscout for single sign-on


To configure single sign-on on **Help Scout** side, you need to send the downloaded **[Metadata XML](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)** to [Help Scout support team](mailto:help@helpscout.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
