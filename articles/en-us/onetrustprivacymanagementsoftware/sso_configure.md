### Configuring OneTrust Privacy Management Software for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **OneTrust Privacy Management Software** side, you need to send the downloaded **Metadata XML** to [OneTrust Privacy Management Software support team](mailto:support@onetrust.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
