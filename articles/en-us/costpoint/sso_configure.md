> **Note:**
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

### Configuring Costpoint for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Costpoint** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Costpoint Client support team](https://www.deltek.com/about/contact-us). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
