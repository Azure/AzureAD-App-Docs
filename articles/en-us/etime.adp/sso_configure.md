### Configuring ADP eTime for single sign-on

 To configure single sign-on on **ADP eTime** side, you need to send the downloaded  **Metadata XML** to [ADP eTime support](https://www.adp.com/contact-us/overview.aspx). They will set this up in order to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
