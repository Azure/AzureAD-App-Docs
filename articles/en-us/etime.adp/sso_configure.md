To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

### Configuring ADP eTime for single sign-on

 To configure single sign-on on **ADP eTime** side, you need to send the downloaded **Metadata XML** to [ADP eTime support](https://www.adp.com/contact-us/overview.aspx). They set this up to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
