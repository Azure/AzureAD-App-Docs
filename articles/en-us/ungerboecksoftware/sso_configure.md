### Configuring Ungerboeck Software for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Ungerboeck Software** side, you need to send the **Thumbprint value** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Ungerboeck Software support team](mailto:Rhonda.Jannings@ungerboeck.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
