> **Note:**
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

### Configuring eCornell for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **eCornell** side, you need to send the **[Downloaded SAML Metadata file](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [eCornell support team](mailto:jschichor@ecornell.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

## Quick Reference

* **Azure AD Single Sign-On Service URL** : %metadata:singleSignOnServiceUrl%

* **[Download Azure AD Signing Certifcate](%metadata:CertificateDownloadRawUrl%)**

* **[Download SAML Metadata file](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)**
