> **Note:**
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

1. To configure single sign-on on **Fuze** side, you need to send the **[Download SAML Metadata file](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)** to [Fuze support team](https://www.fuze.com/support). They configure the SSO on application side to complete the integration.
