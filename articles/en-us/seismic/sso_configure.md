## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Seismic, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Seismic single sign-on enabled subscription

> **Note:**
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

### Configuring Seismic for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Seismic** side, you need to send the **[Downloaded Azure AD Signing Certifcate (Base64 encoded)](%metadata:certificateDownloadBase64Url%)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Seismic support team](mailto:support@seismic.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

## Quick Reference

* **Azure AD Single Sign-On Service URL** : %metadata:singleSignOnServiceUrl%

* **Azure AD Sign Out URL** : %metadata:singleSignOutServiceUrl%

* **Azure AD SAML Entity ID** : %metadata:IssuerUri%

* **[Download Azure AD Signing Certifcate (Base64 encoded)](%metadata:certificateDownloadBase64Url%)**
