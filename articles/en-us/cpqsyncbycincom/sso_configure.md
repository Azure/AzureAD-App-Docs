### Configuring CPQSync by Cinom for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **CPQSync by Cincom** side, you need to send the **[Downloaded Azure AD Signing Certifcate](%metadata:CertificateDownloadRawUrl%)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [CPQSync by Cincom support team](https://cpqsupport.cincomcpq.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

## Quick Reference

* **Login URL** : %metadata:singleSignOnServiceUrl%
