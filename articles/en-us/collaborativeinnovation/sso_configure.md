- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

### Configuring Collaborative Innovation for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Collaborative Innovation** side, you need to send the **[Downloaded SAML Metadata file](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)** to [Collaborative Innovation support team](https://www.unilever.com/contact/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
