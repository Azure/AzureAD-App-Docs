### Configuring OrgChart Now for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **OrgChart Now** side, you need to send the **[Downloaded SAML Metadata file](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)** to [OrgChart Now support team](mailto:ocnsupport@officeworksoftware.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
