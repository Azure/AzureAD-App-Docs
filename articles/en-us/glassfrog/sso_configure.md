## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with GlassFrog, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A GlassFrog single sign-on enabled subscription

> **Note:**
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

### Configuring GlassFrog for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **GlassFrog** side, you need to send the **[Downloaded SAML Metadata file](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)** to [GlassFrog support team](mailto:support@alchemy.fr). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
