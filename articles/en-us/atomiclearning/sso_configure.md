### Configuring Atomic Learning for single sign-on

 To configure single sign-on on **Atomic Learning** side, you need to send the downloaded **[Metadata XML](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)** to [Atomic Learning support team](mailto:cs@atomiclearning.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
