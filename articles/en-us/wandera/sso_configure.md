> **Note:**

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

### Configuring Wandera for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Wandera** side, you need to send the **[Downloaded SAML Metadata file](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Wandera support team](https://www.wandera.com/about-wandera/contact/#supportsection). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

## Quick Reference
