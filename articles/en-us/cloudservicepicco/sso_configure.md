> **Note:**
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

### Configuring Cloud Service PICCO for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Cloud Service PICCO** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Cloud Service PICCO support team](mailto:picco.support@est.fujitsu.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
