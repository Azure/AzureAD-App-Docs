- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

### Configuring Innovation Hub for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Innovation Hub** side, you need to send the copied **Federation Metadata Url** to [Innovation Hub support team](mailto:support@readify.net). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
