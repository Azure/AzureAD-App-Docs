### Configuring Confirmit Horizons for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Confirmit Horizons** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Confirmit Horizons support team](mailto:support@confirmit.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
