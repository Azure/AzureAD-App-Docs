### Configuring iServer Portal for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **iServer Portal** side, you need to send the **Thumbprint Value** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [iServer Portal support team](mailto:support@orbussoftware.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
