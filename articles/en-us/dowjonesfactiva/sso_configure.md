### Configuring Dow Jones Factiva for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Dow Jones Factiva** side, you need to send the downloaded **[Metadata XML](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)** to [Dow Jones Factiva support team](https://www.dowjones.com/contact/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
