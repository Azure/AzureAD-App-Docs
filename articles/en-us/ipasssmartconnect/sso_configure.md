### Configuring iPass SmartConnect for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **iPass SmartConnect** side, you need to send the **[Downloaded SAML Metadata file](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)** and your **Domain name** to [iPass SmartConnect support team](mailto:help@ipass.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
