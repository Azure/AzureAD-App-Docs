### Configuring Bambu by Sprout Social for single sign-on

1. To configure single sign-on on **Bambu by Sprout Social** side, you need to send the downloaded **[SAML Metdata file](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)** and **Azure AD Single Sign-On Service URL** : %metadata:singleSignOnServiceUrl% to [Bambu by Sprout Social support](http://support@getbambu.com). They will set this up in order to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
