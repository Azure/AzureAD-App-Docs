## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Birst Agile Business Analytics, you need the following items:

- A Birst Agile Business Analytics single sign-on enabled subscription

> **Note:**
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

### Configuring Birst Agile Business Analytics for single sign-on

 To configure single sign-on on **Birst Agile Business Analytics** side, you need to send the **[Downloaded Azure AD Signing Certifcate (Base64 encoded)](%metadata:certificateDownloadBase64Url%)**, **Azure AD Sign Out URL** : %metadata:singleSignOutServiceUrl%, **Azure AD SAML Entity ID** : %metadata:IssuerUri%, and **Azure AD Single Sign-On Service URL** : %metadata:singleSignOnServiceUrl% to [Birst Agile Business Analytics support team](mailto:info@birst.com). 

   > [!NOTE]
   > Mention to Birst team that this integration needs SHA256 Algorithm (SHA1 will not be supported) so that they can set the SSO on the appropriate server like **app2101** etc.
