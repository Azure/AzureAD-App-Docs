- A Stormboard single sign-on enabled subscription

> **Note:**
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

### Configuring Stormboard for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Stormboard** side, you need to send the **[Downloaded Azure AD Signing Certifcate (Base64 encoded)](%metadata:certificateDownloadBase64Url%)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Stormboard support team](mailto:support@stormboard.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
