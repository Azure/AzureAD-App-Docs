## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with FM:Systems, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- An FM:Systems single sign-on enabled subscription

> **Note:**
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

### Configuring FM:Systems for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **FM:Systems** side, you need to send the downloaded **[Metadata XML](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)** to [FM:Systems support team](https://fmsystems.com/ask-us/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides. You will get a notification when SSO has been enabled for your subscription.
