### Configuring Explanation Based Auditing System for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Explanation-Based Auditing System** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Explanation-Based Auditing System support team](mailto:support@maizeanalytics.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
