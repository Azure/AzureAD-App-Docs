### Configuring monday.com for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **monday.com** side, you need to send the **[Downloaded Azure AD Signing Certifcate (Base64 encoded)](%metadata:certificateDownloadBase64Url%)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [monday.com support team](mailto:support@monday.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
