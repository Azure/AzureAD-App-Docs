> **Note:**
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- You should not use your production environment, unless this is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get an one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

### Configuring Abintegro for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Abintegro** side, you need to send the downloaded **[Metadata XML](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)** to [Abintegro support team](mailto:support@abintegro.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
