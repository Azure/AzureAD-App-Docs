To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

### Configuring Robin for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Robin** side, you need to send the **[Downloaded Azure AD Signing Certifcate](%metadata:CertificateDownloadRawUrl%)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Robin support team](mailto:support@robinpowered.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

## Quick Reference

* **Login URL** : %metadata:singleSignOnServiceUrl%

* **[Download Azure AD Signing Certifcate](%metadata:CertificateDownloadRawUrl%)**

* **[Download SAML Metadata file](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)**
