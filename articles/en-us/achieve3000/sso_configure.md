### Configuring Achieve3000 for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Achieve3000** side, you need to send the **[Downloaded SAML Metadata file](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)** to [Achieve3000 support team](https://www.achieve3000.com/contact-us/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
