### Configuring Trello for single sign-on

To get SSO configured for your application, go to [Trello enterprise SSO configuration](https://trello.com/sso-configuration) page to send [Trello support team](mailto:support@trello.com) the **Azure AD Single Sign-On Service URL** : %metadata:singleSignOnServiceUrl% and attach the **[Downloaded Azure AD Signing Certifcate (Base64 encoded)](%metadata:certificateDownloadBase64Url%)**.
