## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Firstbird, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Firstbird single sign-on enabled subscription

> **Note:**
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

### Configuring Firstbird for single sign-on

Once you have completed these steps, please send Firstbird the **[Downloaded SAML Metadata file](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)** in a support request via e-email to [support@firstbird.com](mailto:support@firstbird.com) with the subject: "SSO configuration".

Firstbird will then store the configuration in the system accordingly and activate SSO for your account. After that, a member of the support staff will contact you to verify the configuration.

> **Note:**
> You need to have the SSO option included in your contract.
