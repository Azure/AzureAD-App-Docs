### Configuring innotas for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Innotas** side, you need to send the downloaded **[Download SAML Metadata file](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)** to [Innotas support team](https://www.innotas.com/contact). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
