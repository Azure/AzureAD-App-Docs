## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with huddle, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A huddle single sign-on enabled subscription

> **Note:**
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

### Configuring huddle for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on Huddle side, you need to send the downloaded  **[Downloaded Azure AD Signing Certificate (Base64 encoded)](%metadata:certificateDownloadBase64Url%)**, **Azure AD Single Sign-On Service URL** : %metadata:singleSignOnServiceUrl%, and **Azure AD SAML Entity ID** : %metadata:IssuerUri% to [Huddle Client support team](https://huddle.zendesk.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.  

## Quick Reference

* **Azure AD Single Sign-On Service URL** : %metadata:singleSignOnServiceUrl%

* **Azure AD SAML Entity ID** : %metadata:IssuerUri%

* **[Download Azure AD Signing Certifcate (Base64 encoded)](%metadata:certificateDownloadBase64Url%)**
