### Configuring The Funding Portal for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **The Funding Portal** side, you need to send the **[Downloaded SAML Metadata file](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)** to [The Funding Portal support team](mailto:info@regenteducation.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
