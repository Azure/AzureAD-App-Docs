### Configuring Insignia SAML SSO for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Insignia SAML SSO** side, you need to send the **[Downloaded Azure AD Signing Certifcate (Base64 encoded)](%metadata:certificateDownloadBase64Url%)**, **Sign-Out URL, and SAML Single Sign-On Service URL** to [Insignia SAML SSO support team](http://www.insigniasoftware.com/insignia/Techsupport.aspx). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
