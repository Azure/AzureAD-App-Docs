### Configuring ON24 Virtual Environment SAML Connection for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **ON24 Virtual Environment SAML Connection** side, you need to send the **[Downloaded SAML Metadata file](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)** which you have downloaded from Azure portal to [ON24 Virtual Environment SAML Connection support team](https://www.on24.com/about-us/support/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
