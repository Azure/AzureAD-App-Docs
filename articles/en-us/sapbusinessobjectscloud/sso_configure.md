> **Note:**
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

7. Select the appropriate **User Attribute** you want to use for your implementation from list to map to Identity provider. Use the "Custom SAML Mapping" option to enter a custom attribute in the users page or select either "Email" or "USER ID" as the user Attribute. E.x. **Email** is selected here as we have mapped the user identifier claim with the userprincipalname attribute in the **"User Attributes"** section on Azure portal, which provides unique user email, which is sent to the SAP Business Object Cloud application in every successful SAML Response.
