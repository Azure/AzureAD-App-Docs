### Configuring Adoddle cSaas Platform for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Adoddle cSaas Platform** side, you need to send the **[Downloaded SAML Metadata file](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Adoddle cSaas Platform support team](mailto:support@asite.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
