## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Cobalt, you need the following items:

> **Note:**
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

### Configuring Cobalt for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Cobalt** side, you need to send the **[Downloaded Azure AD Signing Certifcate (Base64 encoded)](%metadata:certificateDownloadBase64Url%)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Cobalt support team](https://www.cobalt.net/support/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
