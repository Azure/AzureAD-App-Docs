To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

### Configuring HeyBuddy for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **HeyBuddy** side, you need to send the copied **App Federation Metadata Url** to [HeyBuddy support team](mailto:support@heybuddy.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
