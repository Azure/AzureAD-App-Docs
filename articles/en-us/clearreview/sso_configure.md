> **Note:**

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

### Configuring Clear Review for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Clear Review** side, you need to send the downloaded **Metadata XML** and **Azure AD SAML Entity ID** : %metadata:IssuerUri% to [Clear Review support team](https://clearreview.com/contact/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
