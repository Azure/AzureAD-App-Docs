### Configuring Oracle Fusion ERP for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Oracle Fusion ERP** side, you need to send the downloaded **[Downloaded SAML Metadata file](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Oracle Fusion ERP support team](mailto:jinshu.peethambaran@oracle.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
