To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

### Configuring Perceptyx for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Perceptyx** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Perceptyx support team](mailto:customersupport@perceptyx.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
