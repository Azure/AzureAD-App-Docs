> **Note:**
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

### Configuring Predictix Price Reporting for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Predictix Price Reporting** side, you need to send the **[Downloaded Azure AD Signing Certifcate (Base64 encoded)](%metadata:certificateDownloadBase64Url%)**, **Azure AD Sign Out URL** : %metadata:singleSignOutServiceUrl%, **Azure AD SAML Entity ID** : %metadata:IssuerUri%, and **Azure AD Single Sign-On Service URL** : %metadata:singleSignOnServiceUrl% to [Predictix Price Reporting support team](http://www.infor.com/company/customer-center/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

## Quick Reference

* **Azure AD Single Sign-On Service URL** : %metadata:singleSignOnServiceUrl%

* **Azure AD Sign Out URL** : %metadata:singleSignOutServiceUrl%

* **Azure AD SAML Entity ID** : %metadata:IssuerUri%
