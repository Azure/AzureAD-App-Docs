## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Pantheon, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Pantheon single sign-on enabled subscription

> **Note:**
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

### Configuring Pantheon for single sign-on

 To configure single sign-on on **Pantheon** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate** and **Azure AD Single Sign-On Service URL** : %metadata:singleSignOnServiceUrl% to [Pantheon support team](https://pantheon.io/docs/getting-support/).

 > **Note:**
 > You also need to provide the Email Domain(s) information and Date Time when you want to enable this connection. You can find more details about it from [here](https://pantheon.io/docs/sso-organizations/)
