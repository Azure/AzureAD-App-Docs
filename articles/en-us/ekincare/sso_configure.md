## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with eKincare, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A eKincare single-sign on enabled subscription

> **Note:**
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- You should not use your production environment, unless this is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get an one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

### Configuring eKincare for single sign-on


To configure single sign-on on **eKincare** side, you need to send the downloaded **[SAML Metadata file](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)** to [eKincare support team](mailto:tech@ekincare.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
