### Configuring ARES for Enterprise for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **ARES for Enterprise** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [ARES for Enterprise support team](mailto:support@graebert.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
