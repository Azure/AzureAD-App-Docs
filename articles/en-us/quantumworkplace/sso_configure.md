### Configuring Quantum Workplace for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Quantum Workplace** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Quantum Workplace support team](mailto:support@quantumworkplace.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
