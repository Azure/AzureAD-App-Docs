### Configuring Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO) for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO)** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO) support team](https://www.aliyun.com/service/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
