To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

### Configuring ExcelityGlobal for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **ExcelityGlobal** side, you need to send the **Thumbprint value** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [ExcelityGlobal support team](https://www.excelityglobal.com/contact-us/our-locations/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
