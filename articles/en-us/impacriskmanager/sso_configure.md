> **Note:**
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

### Configuring IMPAC Risk Manager for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **IMPAC Risk Manager** side, you need to send the **[Downloaded Azure AD Signing Certifcate (Base64 encoded)](%metadata:certificateDownloadBase64Url%)** to [IMPAC Risk Manager support team](rmsupport@Impac.co.nz). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
