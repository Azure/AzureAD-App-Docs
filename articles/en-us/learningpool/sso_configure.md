### Configuring Learningpool for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Learningpool Act** side, you need to send the **[Downloaded SAML Metadata file](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)** to [Learningpool Act support team](https://www.Learningpool.com/support). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
