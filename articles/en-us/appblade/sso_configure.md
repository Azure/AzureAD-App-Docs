> [!Note]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

### Configuring AppBlade for single sign-on

 To configure single sign-on on **AppBlade** side, you need to send the **[Downloaded SAML Metadata file](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)** to [AppBlade support team](mailto:support@appblade.com). Also, please ask them to configure the **SSO Issuer URL** as **https://appblade.com/saml**. This setting is required for single sign-on to work.
