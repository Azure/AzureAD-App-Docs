> **Note:**

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial here: [Trial offer](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

### Configuring Skilljar for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Skilljar** side, you need to send the **[Downloaded SAML Metadata file](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)**, and **Name Identifier Format Value - urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress** to [Skilljar support team](http://support.skilljar.com/hc/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
