## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with ADP Globalview, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- An ADP Globalview single-sign on enabled subscription

> [!Note]:
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- You should not use your production environment, unless this is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get an one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

### Configuring ADP Globalview for single sign-on

10. To configure single sign-on on **ADP Globalview** side, you need to send the downloaded **certificate (Base64)**,**Sign-Out URL, SAML Entity ID and SAML Single Sign-On Service URL** to [ADP Globalview support](https://www.adp.com/contact-us/overview.aspx). They will set this up in order to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.


### Next steps

To ensure users can sign-in to ADP Globalview after it has been configured to use Azure Active Directory, review the following tasks and topics:

- User accounts must be pre-provisioned into ADP Globalview prior to sign-in. To set this up, see Provisioning.
 
- Users must be assigned access to ADP Globalview in Azure AD to sign-in. To assign users, see Users.
 
- To configure access polices for ADP Globalview users, see Access Policies.
 
- For additional information on deploying single sign-on to users, see [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis#deploying-azure-ad-integrated-applications-to-users).
