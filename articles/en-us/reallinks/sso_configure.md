- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

### Configuring Real Links for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Real Links** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Real Links support team](mailto:support@reallinks.io). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
