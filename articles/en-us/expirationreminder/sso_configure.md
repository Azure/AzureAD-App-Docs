### Configuring Expiration Reminder for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Expiration Reminder** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Raw)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Expiration Reminder support team](mailto:support@expirationreminder.net). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
