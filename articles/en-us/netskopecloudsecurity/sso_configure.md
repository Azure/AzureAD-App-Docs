### Configuring Netskope Cloud Security for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Netskope Cloud Security** side, you need to send the **[Downloaded Azure AD Signing Certifcate](%metadata:CertificateDownloadRawUrl%)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Netskope Cloud Security support team](mailto:support@netskope.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

## Quick Reference

* **Azure AD Single Sign-On Service URL** : %metadata:singleSignOnServiceUrl%

* **[Download Azure AD Signing Certifcate](%metadata:CertificateDownloadRawUrl%)**
