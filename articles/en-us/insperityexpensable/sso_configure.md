> **Note:**
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

### Configuring Insperity ExpensAble for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Insperity ExpensAble** side, you need to send the downloaded **[certificate](%metadata:certificateDownloadBase64Url%)**, **Azure AD Single Sign-On Service URL** : %metadata:singleSignOnServiceUrl% and **Azure AD SAML Entity ID** : %metadata:IssuerUri% to [Insperity ExpensAble support team](http://expensable.com/support/support-overview). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.


## Quick Reference

* **Azure AD Single Sign-On Service URL** : %metadata:singleSignOnServiceUrl%
