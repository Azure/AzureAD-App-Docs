### Configuring Wikispaces for single sign-on

To configure single sign-on on **Wikispaces** side, you need to send the **[Downloaded SAML Metadata file](%metadata:metadataDownloadUrl%)** to [Wikispaces support team](https://www.wikispaces.com/site/help). You will get a notification as soon as the configuration has been completed.
