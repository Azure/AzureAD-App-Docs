# Next steps

To ensure users can sign-in to %metadata:DisplayName% after it has been configured to use Azure Active Directory, review the following tasks and topics:

- User accounts must be pre-provisioned into %metadata:DisplayName% prior to sign-in. To set this up, see Provisioning.
    
- Users must be assigned access to %metadata:DisplayName% in Azure AD to sign-in. To assign users, see Users.
    
- To configure access polices for %metadata:DisplayName% users, see Access Policies.
    
- For additional information on deploying single sign-on to users, see [this article](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis/#deploying-azure-ad-integrated-applications-to-users).
