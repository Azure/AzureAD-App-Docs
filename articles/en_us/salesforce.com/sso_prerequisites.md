##Prerequisites

You must have a valid tenant in [Salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/). If you are using a Salesforce Sandbox environment, please see the [Salesforce Sandbox integration tutorial](https://go.microsoft.com/fwLink/?LinkID=521879).

Before you can configure single sign-on, you must set up and deploy a custom domain for your Salesforce environment. For instructions on how to do that, see [Set Up a Domain Name](https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=domain_name_setup.htm&language=en_US).

> [IMPORTANT] If you are using a Salesforce.com **trial** account, then you will be unable to configure automated user provisioning. Trial accounts do not have the necessary API access enabled until they are purchased.

> You can get around this limitation by using a [free developer account](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup) to complete this tutorial.
